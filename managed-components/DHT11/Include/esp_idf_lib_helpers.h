/* XXX this header file does not need to include freertos/FreeRTOS.h.
 * but without it, ESP8266 RTOS SDK does not include `sdkconfig.h` in correct
 * order. as this header depends on sdkconfig.h, sdkconfig.h must be included
 * first. however, the SDK includes this header first, then includes
 * `sdkconfig.h` when freertos/FreeRTOS.h is not explicitly included. an
 * evidence can be found in `build/${COMPONENT}/${COMPONENT}.d` in a failed
 * build.
